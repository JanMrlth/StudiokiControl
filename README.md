# Studioki Controll

## Overview
The Studioki Controller is a temperatur controller for kilns. It uses an ESP32 to controll its functions. Because it is build with one specific oven in mind, we use its temperature probe. (https://laborofen.com/de/Steuerungen/Thermoelemente/Thermoelement-NiCr-Ni7) These thermocouples are used in a wide variety of ovens.
